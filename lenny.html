                        <p> My name is Leonard Morales and I am running for District Attorney of the 34th Judicial District, covering El Paso, Hudspeth and Culberson Counties.  I am running for District Attorney because I believe that our community deserves and can do much better in the administration and prosecution of criminal cases.  We deserve much better than we have had in recent years.  I believe that I have the experience, background and talents to make the District Attorneyâ€™s Office better, more efficient, transparent and responsive to the people of this District.  If you have been watching the news you have seen the epidemic of DWI ravage this District. You have seen the plight of soldiers and veterans go ignored and even worsened by our criminal justice process.  You will have seen this District Attorney fail or fall far short again and again in high profile cases. But after 23 years in office nothing much changes, the DA licks his wounds and moves on. Our District deserves better and this office can do better with proper leadership.</p>
                        <p> For over a decade now I have practiced as a trial lawyer in the Courts of El Paso County, the Federal Courts, Military Courts and Appellate Courts of the United States.  I have forged a reputation as a formidable criminal defense lawyer.  Against the odds I have won acquittals in State, Federal and Military courts on numerous occasions.  I have tried high profile cases involving Federal RICO, Capital Murder, War Crimes, Intoxicated Manslaughter and countless other types of offenses.  I believe I have the most diverse experience of any criminal defense attorney in El Paso, Culberson or Hudspeth Counties.  Before I came to practice in El Paso and during that practice I served honorably in the United States Army as a both a line officer and JAG with a mixture of active duty and reserve time.  I have served at multiple posts and deployed overseas.  After 25 years of service I retired from the U.S. Army in 2014.</p>

                            <p>I want to bring that wealth of experience and knowledge to the Office of the District Attorney and use it for the people of this community.  I will bring practicality, perspective and fairness to the prosecution of cases.  But make no mistake, those who break the law in El Paso, Culberson and Hudspeth Counties will be prosecuted vigorously, fully and ethically. The victims of crimes are entitled to justice and criminals should pay for their crimes.
                                These are my promises to you, a new vision and new direction for our community.
